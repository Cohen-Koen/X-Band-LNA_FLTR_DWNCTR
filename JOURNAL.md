This is my journal of the design and building process of **X-BAND LNB DUAL BOARD SYSTEM**.

## 10/17/2025 - V1  

As of now I have prototyped my first version. Some design updates:

• must add CPW routing.
• Better placing of solder mask.
• simulation needed.

Overall construction was easy and the cost was low due to sampling from MiniCircuits. Need a better radio to test the upper bounds and a proper signal synthesizer to test the overall system performance.![IMG_7249.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjcwMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9559f20a1fe872044ca72e7444db961874126cd2/IMG_7249.jpeg)
